Hello, I'm Luke 👋

🏦 I’m currently an Engineering Director at <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo Bank</a>, leading Platform and Data engineering.
<br>
<br>
I love building and operating resilient distributed systems. My experience is mostly in reliability engineering, developer experience, FinOps, incident management, and helping people and companies scale. More recently I've also built teams focused on AI adoption and augmenting the developer experience to help our engineers go even faster. 
<br>
<br>
I've been working with Monzo since early 2019 where I’m responsible for building a world-class technology and data platform to make money work for everyone. 
<br>
<br>
Before Monzo I worked in various engineering and technology roles with <a href="https://ovo.com/">OVO</a>, <a href="https://www.thewhitecompany.com/uk/">The White Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.boots.com/">Boots</a>. I’ve also spent some time as a consultant in the public sector with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education">UK Department for Education</a>.
