The weekend is for football. As a fan, I’m irrational. But as a leader, I can’t afford to be.</p>

<p>My team is West Bromwich Albion and we play in the second tier of the English professional football pyramid, aka The Championship. We’ve had better times, but in recent years we’ve slipped into mediocrity and have struggled to mount a real attempt to make it back to the riches of the Premier League. Surprisingly, the emotional rollercoaster of watching football at The Hawthorns (our home stadium) has taught me more about my day job than I expected.</p>

<p>When results aren’t going our way on the pitch, everyone has an opinion. The formation is wrong. That player doesn’t care. The manager is clueless. When I’m watching some of the most mediocre football of my life, I won’t lie, my reaction is exactly the same. We judge the team on outcomes and we want to see passion, commitment, and wins. And when we don’t get those things, well, we start to point fingers at individuals. And more often than not, those fingers point at the manager.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago we were playing a home game and I took the photo below after we’d just drew 0-0 to a team who are rock bottom of the league (sorry Sheffield Wednesday fans). I was a bit late with my snap but the photo shows Karlan Grant, one of our players, just after he finished having an argument with a fan in the stands. I don’t know what was said, but what I do know is that a) he’s frustrated enough to bite back to criticism from the stands and b) there were 3 or 4 of his teammates running towards him to drag him away. For me there are some positives to take from that — he cares enough to bite, and his teammates care enough to at least steer him away from getting involved further.</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>In my day job I’ve learned that building a team, especially one operating at high velocity with high stakes, is rarely as simple as assembling a team of competent professionals and leaving them to it. I’ve also learnt that it’s wise to deeply understand and then be hard on the problem, rather than immediately on the individual. The same goes for the manager.</p>

<p>More often than not, the issue isn’t competence (though yes, sometimes it is). The problems generally lie elsewhere — and my main message in this post is that in football, just like in software engineering, not everything is as it may seem…</p>

<h2 id="-the-invisible-game">🫥 The invisible game</h2>

<p>From the stands, we don’t see the training ground. We don’t see the personal issues a player is carrying, the tactical instruction they’ve been given, or the quiet lack of confidence rippling through the dressing room after a few bad results (we’ve just hit 8 consecutive away defeats so I bet the staff coach journey home this weekend was fun).</p>

<p>It is exactly the same in engineering. However — when an engineering squad misses a deadline or a platform migration stalls, the first thing I ask is “what are the factors contributing to this?” before making knee-jerk reaction changes. In football however, we jumpimmediately to ask “why aren’t they working harder?” or “sack the manager!” after a few bad results (hi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mason">Ryan Mason 👋</a>).</p>

<p>This is where the invisible side of the game comes in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fear or flow? Is the team paralysed by fear of breaking production, or are they safe to take calculated risks?</li>
  <li>Do they actually believe in what they’re doing? (e.g. do they see the impact their efforts will lead to and do they influence/have autonomy over the methods to take them there?)</li>
  <li>Do they have a manager that inspires them to do better (e.g. are they learning and growing as a result of their leadership?)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-belief-is-a-multiplier">🧘 Belief is a multiplier</h2>

<p>West Brom can’t buy success by buying the best players and the best manager. We don’t have the money and we’re not a particularly exciting proposition for the top players in the game. In order to succeed we have to be greater than the sum of our parts — we have to have belief we can be better. Now I have no idea whether this team have belief or not as I’m not there behind the scenes, but in my job, I know that belief is a multiplier regardless of the company — and if we want to succeed, we’ve got a better chance with belief than without it.</p>

<p>When a team believes in the mission, they understand the outcomes they’re working towards, and they trust their manager has their back, they play with their heads up. They take calculated risks. They cover for each other’s mistakes rather than pointing fingers. They share ownership over problems.</p>

<p>When that belief is gone (e.g. when the dressing room is lost),  it doesn’t matter how talented your senior engineers or your star players are. You get slow decision-making, a lack of cohesion, and a culture of “that’s not my job.” You get less optimal outcomes, and that’s then when scruity turns to individuals. Trust me — I watched West Brom when they were managed by Tony Pulis and it was the worst football I’ve seen in my life, but I could suffer it as the outcomes (for most of his tenure) were good.</p>

<p>This is exactly the time we should be looking to deeply understand the contributors to the problem <em>before</em> we call the players out.</p>

<h2 id="-the-final-whistle">😗 The final whistle</h2>

<p>Engineering, like football, is a results business. We are here to ship, to scale, and to win. But you don’t get results by staring at the scoreboard. You get them by obsessing over culture in the dressing room or the office and the human systems that lead us to success.</p>

<p>So here’s my advice. By all means, scream at the team and the manager on Saturday afternoon — but when the score looks bad, don’t just look at the players. Look at the belief, the culture — and when you’re back to work on Monday morning, remember you’re the one capable of changing the game.</p>]]></content><author><name>Luke Briscoe</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monday to Friday, I work in software engineering.

<p>Last month I went over to San Diego to speak at the <a href="https://x.finops.org/">FinOps X conference</a>. The conference is ~2000 people from all kinds of backgrounds — engineers, accountants, analysts and other FinOps professionals. I’ve been aware of the foundation and the work they do for the last couple of years, so I was thrilled when our talk proposal was accepted. We shared our cloud cost journey at Monzo to-date, and dug into how we’re solving some of the unique problems a microservices architecture can present when it comes to accurately forecasting and attributing cloud spend.</p>

<p>I gave the talk with my colleague Selda, who leads our Cloud FinOps squad at Monzo. One of the key insights we shared was how we’ve got into a much better place with our cloud costs as a result of collaborating across different disciplines — namely by combining backend engineers with data scientists, analytics engineers and accountants. As a result, on forecasting cloud spend alone we’ve gone from a ~15% error rate in our forecasts to consistently predicting spend to over 95% accuracy. That’s improving every month, and we’re at around 97.5% at the time I’m writing this post (with our goal set to consistently be above 99%).</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to be invited to <a href="https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london/agenda/">run a workshop on the Director+ track this year at LDX3 (LeadDev) in London</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lukebriscoe/ldx3-2025/blob/main/LDX3-LB-2025.pdf">The slides I used in the workshop are available on Github</a>.</p>

<p>My personal highlight was how engaged everyone was — it was enlightening to hear everyone’s stories and experiences, and it was so good to see everyone’s commitment to learning and sharing. If you’re reading this and you were there — thank you!</p>

<p>I had a great time running the session, and I’ve had lots of follow-up conversations (and some lovely feedback!) since. If you’d like me to run a similar workshop to explore some of these concepts with your teams, please get in touch through one of the links on my <a href="https://lukebriscoe.com/about/">about page</a>!</p>

<hr />
<p>In the workshop I aim to deliver two key outcomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Equip everyone with some new tools and techniques for identifying and mitigating engineering risks, and introduce the concept of anti-fragility</li>
  <li>Share some of the key capabilities to build to help respond effectively when things inevitably go wrong</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything I share is from my own personal experience, and things I practice day-to-day building anti-fragile, resilient systems.</p>]]></content><author><name>Luke Briscoe</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">📈 Convex payoffs</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/convex-payoffs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="📈 Convex payoffs" /><published>2025-02-11T21:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-11T21:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/convex-payoffs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/convex-payoffs/"><![CDATA[<p>Four years ago today (the timing of this post wasn’t intentional!), I’m sat at home doomscrolling on Twitter. The UK is in lockdown; my timeline is dominated with bad news. But then, I stumble across this post:</p>

  <img width="400" height="300" src="https://github.com/lukebriscoe/lukebriscoe.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/Screenshot%202025-02-11%20at%2021.16.13.jpeg?raw=true" />
</p>

<p><em>Convex payoffs: investing in actions that provide compounding, long-term benefits.</em></p>

<p>Now on the surface this doesn’t scream ‘good news story’, but it triggered some formative thinking for me. It’s helped me crystallise the way I think about software engineering performance, and optimising for current and future success — both for me, and the teams of engineers and engineering leaders I support.</p>

<p>The idea is simple. Optimise for actions that are going to help you in the long-term, knowing they’ll also support your short-term success. Those actions include some of the things mentioned in the post above, such as building your reputation, maintaining a strong network and acting with integrity. I’d also add:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fail fast, learn faster</li>
  <li>Never repeat the same mistake</li>
  <li>Take <a href="https://lukebriscoe.com/responsibility/">total responsibility</a>; avoid the ‘somebody else’s problem’ trap</li>
</ul>

<p>In the long-term, it’s the things in the convex payoffs bracket that help you stretch, grow, and perform better. It’s a false economy to optimise only for the things that you think really matter today — for example, your performance review rating, getting a bonus, or getting a pay rise. Sure, those things matter and might be incredibly important depending on your circumstances. But in the grand scheme of your career, they offer only marginal gains. If you’re interested in long-term growth and success, you need to have an eye on the convex payoffs.</p>

<p>I’m writing this short post knowing that many engineers and engineering leaders will be heading into annual performance reviews in the next few months. This might just be the thing that you needed to read regardless of if you’re frustrated with the outcome, or you’re delighted and wondering where to focus next.</p>

<p>As you reflect on your performance and career growth, ask yourself: are you focusing on the things that will compound over time? If not, what’s one small shift you can make today?</p>]]></content><author><name>Luke Briscoe</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Four years ago today (the timing of this post wasn’t intentional!), I’m sat at home doomscrolling on Twitter.

</p>

<h2 id="-i-intend-to">🙋 ‘I intend to’</h2>
<p>“<em>I intend to…</em>”. Three little words that have had a big impact on my career.</p>

<p>I found the phrase when I first read “Turn the Ship Around” by David Marquet and it’s stuck with me ever since.</p>

<h2 id="-turn-the-ship-around">🚢 Turn the ship around</h2>
<p>In the book submarine captain David Marquet shares his approach to leadership aboard the USS Santa Fe nuclear submarine. The submarine was one of the worst performing in its fleet, and Marquet’s story is one of turning it around into being one of the best.</p>

<p>The idea at the core is that success relies on distributing control and authority to the people best placed to make the decisions, and <em>ask them what they intend to do</em> rather than giving instructions or handing down decisions. Hence the phrase “I intend to…” was born.</p>

<h2 id="-my-experience">💭 My experience</h2>
<p>My experience has been overwhelmingly positive when following this approach and using “I intend to…” to share what I plan to do about something. I’ve used it both as both an individual contributor (IC) and as an engineering leader. Yes, it felt a little unnatural to use the words at first. But once you get over the initial weirdness, it’s surprising how quickly it becomes a natural part of your language.</p>

<p>I did a quick Slack search whilst I was drafting this post and I’ve used the phrase 16 times in my written comms this year. I did the same search for a team I work closely with and they’ve used it 28 times. I’ve got to admit it was very rewarding to decide to write this post and find so many recent examples of me and my teams using it in practice 😅</p>

<p>To bring this to life, I used “I intend to” recently when deciding to change up one of our weekly business review meetings. I shared my intent to trial a new format to drive some different outcomes, sharing what and how I intended to change it. The response to that? Two of my peers signalling their support for the decision, but it also gave the group the chance to challenge and ask for more information about why.</p>

<p>In this example I couldn’t share my intent until I’d got clear on the problem I wanted to solve, and the way I wanted to solve it. For me that’s where the real value from using “I intend to” comes from - you need to have done the upfront thinking or have specific knowledge before you commit to what you intend to do.</p>

<h2 id="-so-why-is-it-so-impactful">💥 So why is it so impactful?</h2>

<p>🧑‍💻 For me as an IC: <br />
– Facilitates me deeply understanding the action I intend to take to solve a problem — I take the time upfront to build confidence in my reasons</p>

<p>– Encourages me to hold myself accountable - I’m not going to state my intent and then not follow through with something</p>

<p>– Improves my decision making - I won’t block on someone else giving me confirmation before I go ahead; I state my intent as as way of signalling what I’m going to do next (giving others the opportunity to challenge)</p>

<p>– Encourages me to communicate openly and proactively. In turn, this sets a precedent for others to follow</p>

<p>🧑‍✈️ For me as a leader: <br />
– Pushing the decision making authority to the people who are best placed to make it, improving the decision making process</p>

<p>– Improving visibility over the decisions being made in a team (particularly if you encourage async communication)</p>

<p>– Increasing team initiative and ownership — teams know I won’t by default make decisions for them, so they need to seize the initiative and state what they intend to do (in turn opening up an opportunity to challenge or understand the reasons behind the decision further)</p>

<p>– Boosting trust between people in teams - teams start sharing clearer expectations with each other that creates accountability</p>

<p>In combination all of these things compound into something really quite impactful. Over time you’ll see this way of operating catch on across teams, and enable more and more of the smart people you’ve hired to take strong ownership and licence over their work. Yes you’ll probably make some mistakes along the way - but creating a culture of accountability and biasing towards action will very likely produce more good outcomes than bad.</p>

<h2 id="-use-it-next-time-youre-faced-with-a-decision">🙌 Use it next time you’re faced with a decision</h2>
<p>So. If you’re an IC, next time you’re about to ask what the next step is or what you should pick up next, try deciding for yourself and communicate it by saying “I intend to…”. 
If you’re a leader, empower your team by encouraging them to express their intent when they’re faced with a decision. Be deliberate and create the space (and set the expectation) that you want them to state their intentions rather than leaving it for you or someone else to decide.</p>

<p>You might be surprised by the positive changes it brings about. I certainly was!
<br />
<br />
I’d love to hear from you about where this has worked in your experience, and what other approaches you’ve taken to empower great decision making in your teams! Feel free to share with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lbriscoe/">LinkedIn</a>!

</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to head over to Vegas earlier this month for AWS re:Invent. We had a couple of speaking slots to talk about the work we’ve done at Monzo over the last year, and it was my first taste of a conference of this size. I’d say <em>surreal</em> is the word.</p>

<p>While there, I had the opportunity to go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTRBVPvzt9w">Werner Vogels’ keynote</a> (it’s worth a watch if you have the time - even just for the production value!). He spent a big chunk of it introducing <a href="https://thefrugalarchitect.com/">“The Frugal Architect”</a>.</p>

<p>This resonated with me personally as a few years back I had one of those moments of realisation that the AWS bill was getting too big. Ever since, a day hasn’t passed without me contemplating cloud cost optimisation.</p>

<p>This post is a roundup of the key themes Vogels introduced, with a sprinkling of how I think this applies to engineering teams (with an obvious bias towards Platform given my current responsibilities 😄).</p>

<p>(On a lighter note, I found it amusing yet insightful to hear the CTO of a leading cloud provider emphasise the importance of controlling spend – but better spent with them than a competitor, I guess…)</p>

<h2 id="3️⃣-three-pillars-of-frugality">3️⃣ Three pillars of frugality</h2>
<p>I like the way he grouped the key laws into three pillars of <em>Design, Measure</em>, and <em>Optimise</em>.</p>

<p>I’m intending to use these deliberately with my teams next year as I think it provides a nice condensed way of thinking about cost optimisation. I also think the law themselves do a good job of framing cloud frugality as something that every engineer needs to care about, not just the team who operate the platform. Let’s briefly dig in to each of these pillars.</p>

<h3 id="-design">🎨 Design</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Cost is a non-functional requirement</em></li>
  <li><em>Systems that last align cost to business</em></li>
  <li><em>Architecting is a series of trade-offs</em></li>
</ul>

<p>But how do you do this? For me this means treating cost as a first class citizen regardless of what area of the business you’re working in. My experience running platform teams that abstract away complexity for engineers (so they can focus on building great products for customers and not solving infra-related problems) is that we can often abstract away the cost from them too. If you operate a central platform, there’s a risk cost becomes <em>your</em> problem to solve rather than something that’s considered upfront by the teams building.</p>

<p>Aligning cost to business makes sense to me - do you understand the true cost of offering your product/feature?  Establishing how much you’re willing to spend on operating a product or feature is a key first step - and you can make the right trade offs from then on.</p>

<p><em>A genuine question that I’d love to hear from you about – how do you integrate cost considerations into your design processes?</em></p>

<h3 id="-measure">📊 Measure</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Unobserved systems lead to unknown costs</em></li>
  <li><em>Cost aware architectures implement cost controls</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I think this pillar is obvious (especially if you’ve had to solve any kind of cost problem in the past). If you don’t know what you’re spending, you can’t track it. And if you can’t track it, how will you know what to optimise?</p>

<p>If you’re watching Vogels’ talk back, I really liked the example used about the identical houses in Amsterdam who had wildly varying energy consumption. Turns out that the houses who had their energy meters visible in the hallway for residents consumed significantly less energy than the ones who had theirs in the basement…</p>

<h3 id="-optimise">📉 Optimise</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Cost optimisation is incremental</em></li>
  <li><em>Unchallenged success leads to assumptions</em></li>
</ul>

<p>‘Cost optimisation is incremental’ is probably my favourite law of them all. Reaffirming that cost optimisation is never ‘done’ is an important message for teams internally. Set up your observability, put sensible thresholds and alerts in place, and keep deliberately chipping away at it - just as you would your technical debt. Sounds super obvious, right…but are you doing it?!</p>

<h2 id="-frugal-architecture-in-practice">🤾 Frugal architecture in practice</h2>
<p>Embracing the role of a frugal architect isn’t just about cutting costs. It’s more than that - it’s about every engineer taking responsibility for making sustainable, well considered decisions about how and when to build.</p>

<p>Broadly I felt validated that I’m approaching the problem of cost control and optimisation in the ‘right’ way so far. It provides a useful framework that we can apply in our environments to make the point that spending money sensibly is the responsibility of <em>all</em> engineers.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear from you about the various tools and approaches you’ve found effective — feel free to get in touch!</p>

I had a great time sharing some of my lessons from over the years and also getting to know so many people afterwards - thanks again to everyone who came along!</em></p>

<h2 id="-on-call-in-context">📟 On-call in context</h2>

<p>First up, when I’m talking about on-call, I’m talking about having a software engineer (or multiple) available 24x7 to respond to important alerts. Those alerts could suggest something has gone wrong, or something needs human intervention <em>before</em> it goes wrong - but regardless, it needs a rapid response.</p>

<h2 id="️-monzos-on-call-journey">♻️ Monzo’s on-call journey</h2>

<p>I spent most of the time in the talk sharing what I’ve learnt from scaling on-call at Monzo over the last few years. We’ve blogged about this on a few occasions on the Monzo blog (see <a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2018/09/20/on-call">this post</a>, <a href="https://monzo.com/blog/how-weve-evolved-on-call-at-monzo">this post</a> and <a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2022-02-24/scaling-our-on-call-process">this post</a> for the originals!). Much of my talk was about bringing the key messages from those three blogs to life, and sharing some of the lessons I’ve learnt personally along the way.</p>

<p>We start things off with the early days at Monzo - ‘the rocketship’ phase.</p>

<h2 id="-the-rocketship">🚀 The Rocketship</h2>

<p>The early days of on-call used a super simple model. We defined our critical alerts that needed an immediate response, hooked them into PagerDuty to notify someone about it, and then had a group of engineers carry the pager so we could respond. We started out with a single rota with a small group of engineers on-call, and over time as we scaled we grew the number of engineers on-call in total.</p>

<p>A single engineer would be on-call for a week at a time, and they’d be on-call for everything engineering-related at the company. These engineers formed what we called our ‘primary’ on-call rota, and they were the first point of contact for any alerts. Their job was to either fix the problem, or find someone who could.</p>

<p>The high-level workflow looked something like this:</p>

<p align="center"> 

<img width="500" height="230" src="https://github.com/lukebriscoe/lukebriscoe.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/model1.png?raw=true" />

</p>

<p>This served us well for a couple of years - as more engineers joined, we grew the size of our primary rota and cycled more engineers in. Then we added our shadow on-call schedule into the mix too.</p>

<p>The shadow rota meant that we’d have two people on-call at once for all of our systems. The primary on-caller would take the lead on a page, and the shadow on-caller would observe and support. Their main focus was to get comfortable with being on-call, learn how our systems work, and improve our documentation.</p>

<p>It also provided a nice on-ramp to the primary on-call schedule, and opened up some good mentoring opportunities for engineers. When I joined the company in early 2019, this was still the model we were using.  It shows how well a simple on-call model can scale. Maybe something this simple is all you’ll ever need at your company!</p>

<h3 id="-pros-and-cons">💭 Pros and cons</h3>

<p>🟢 We’d get a human onto a problem very quickly<br /></p>

<p>🟢 On-callers got broad exposure to our platform, and by extension, it provided good learning opportunities for them<br /></p>

<p>🟢 It created strong incentives for engineers to document their code well, write high quality runbooks, and build resilience into their designs. Engineers knew that someone else might be responding to a problem with their services, so built with that in mind<br /></p>

<p>🟠 As we scaled we found it more difficult to onboard new engineers to the rota. As we started to grow as an org and split into different teams, on-callers had to know a lot about our technology<br /></p>

<p>🟠 On-call was a centrally owned process and set up to work in one way. Teams couldn’t easily optimise for their own services<br /></p>

<p>🟠 Our resolution times could have been even faster. Our response times were super fast, but sometimes an engineer would be paged and they’d have to spend time building context of the system that was broken<br /></p>

<p>Considering all of this, it was time to evolve things further..
<br /></p>

<h2 id="️-the-scale-up">⬆️ The Scale Up</h2>

<p>The next significant evolution of on-call came around about the time we’d hit our first 1 million customers. We introduced a new layer of ‘specialists’ who sat under our existing primary/shadow on-call rota. It looked a little something like this:</p>

<p align="center"> 

<img width="650" height="250" src="https://github.com/lukebriscoe/lukebriscoe.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/model2.png?raw=true" />

</p>

<p>By now we’d scaled the engineering org to have more dedicated specialist teams. Those teams were working on things like our platform and in specialist payments teams. We found that often it was expertise in these areas that we needed during incidents, and now that we had specialist teams available, it made sense to page them in when they were needed.</p>

<p>We’d staff the specialist rotas with 4-6 engineers from some of these teams, and they were available as a formal escalation path for the primary/shadow on-callers. The process largely worked the same way as before, but the primary/shadow pair of on-call engineers now had quick access to specialist knowledge when they needed it.</p>

<h3 id="-pros-and-cons-1">💭 Pros and cons</h3>

<p>🟢 We had quicker access to teams with the right context and knowledge to be able to get them involved <br /></p>

<p>🟢 Our response times remained super fast, and our resolution times sped up too<br /></p>

<p>🟠 We were growing rapidly and hiring lots of new engineers. At times our specialist teams were still building knowledge themselves<br /></p>

<p>🟠 Where problems clearly needed a specialist, the role of the primary on-caller basically became 1st line triage<br /></p>

<p>🟠 And as a result, there was still some friction in the process to get the right responders<br /></p>

<p>So here comes the next evolution..!
<br /></p>

<h2 id="-the-mature-org">🧓 The Mature Org</h2>

<p>This was the point where we were a much larger company, serving maybe ~3 million customers, and many of our teams and processes were more mature. We decided to push the alerts closer to what we call ‘collectives’ (aka departments) across Monzo.</p>

<p>We reorganised our on-call schedules to be domain specific. We’d pool together 6-8 engineers from across many teams within a collective, and they’d act as the primary on-callers for critical alerts in their area of expertise. It looked something like this:</p>

<p align="center"> 

<img width="600" height="300" src="https://github.com/lukebriscoe/lukebriscoe.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/model3.png?raw=true" />

</p>

<p>An interesting problem to solve here was one of ‘how do we route the right alerts to the right teams now we have multiple?!’. We solved this by defining codeowners for each of our microservices and platform components in code, and then mapping that owner to a corresponding PagerDuty schedule.</p>

<p>For example, If a critical alert fired relating to our Faster Payments processor, it’d be routed to the schedule staffed by Payments engineers as that collective was defined as the service codeowner.</p>

<p>This model worked very well for us for another 18-24 months:</p>

<h3 id="-pros-and-cons-2">💭 Pros and cons</h3>

<p>🟢 The main benefit was that we were skipping the 1st line / primary on-caller step, and going direct to the teams who had engineers working on problems specific to their domain <br /></p>

<p>🟢 We’d greatly increased our chances that the page would land with someone who knows something about that system. Increasingly we wouldn’t need to page another team for support - leading to faster resolution times <br /></p>

<p>🟠 But, it still wasn’t perfect and we felt we could do even better - so we evolved things again…
<br /></p>

<h2 id="-today">🤙 Today</h2>

<p>And so here we are with how things are set up today serving our ~7 million customers. We introduced this way of managing on-call around the ~4.5m customer mark.</p>

<p>This process works incredibly well for us right now, and we know it will scale as we grow as a business. We’ve now completely decentralised on-call - so pages/alerts are routed directly to the individual team that owns them. We respond rapidly, and have the right engineers immediately available to solve any problems - which has seen our resolution times improve again. It looks like this:</p>

<p align="center"> 

<img width="600" height="300" src="https://github.com/lukebriscoe/lukebriscoe.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/model4.png?raw=true" />

</p>

<p>And this is pretty obvious, right? <em>Of course we’d just route the alert directly to the team that can fix it?</em></p>

<p>We were able to do this mainly because our engineering teams were all well established and well staffed by this time to manage their <em>own</em> healthy on-call rotation.</p>

<p>One of the key benefits with this devolved model of on-call is that teams have been able to optimise their processes to best suit the level of service they need to offer. Engineering Managers in each team are responsible for organising their on-call schedules. It’s also down to the teams to set things up appropriately tailored to the systems that they own, and to iterate on and optimise it as necessary.</p>

<p>In previous models on-call was managed centrally by me and a few others, and we were trying to apply a one-size-fits-all approach across all teams. THat worked well for a while, but the model we’re iterated towards today means we can optimise to operate our services in the very best way possible. The best outcome for our teams and our customers!
<br /></p>

<h2 id="-on-call-as-your-superpower">🦸 ‘On-call as your superpower…’</h2>

<p>Once I’d covered the history of on-call, I wrapped things up in the talk by sharing three key bits of advice from my personal experience. I shared that when done well, on-call has the potential to become a superpower <em>and</em> an enabler for your business.<br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="-1-put-humans-at-the-centre-of-your-on-call-process">👪 1. Put humans at the centre of your on-call process</h3>

<p>Design your processes around treating humans well. We’re not machines! As some practical advice, you can consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Giving teams time in hours to investigate deviant system behaviour that they have been paged for</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giving them time off in lieu if they’ve been paged overnight - and encourage this to be the norm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paying engineers for being on-call!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Empowering teams to to set on-call up in the most optimal way to serve their customers/users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encouraging managers to join on-call and get involved by (at least) supporting on-callers as an escalation point. Get them leading by example!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>By doing this I’ve actually seen waiting lists in some teams for engineers to go on-call, which is unheard of! <br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="-2-dont-accept-deviant-system-behaviour">👺 2. Don’t accept deviant system behaviour</h3>

<p>This is one of <a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2018/06/29/engineering-principles">Monzo’s engineering principles</a> and it’s served us incredibly well over the years.</p>

<p>If someone is paged, don’t brush it off and think it’s ok. Run an analysis of what happened and stop it from re-occurring. Or if you can’t stop it, define how you can fix it faster next time or respond better.</p>

<p>If you’re a leader, give your teams time in-hours to do this, and be especially hard on false alarms. Don’t risk your teams becoming desensitised to alerts that are paging them. <br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="️-3-set-up-an-effective-way-to-iterate-on-your-on-call-process">♻️ 3. Set up an effective way to iterate on your on-call process</h3>

<p>Make sure you’re sharing your on-call lessons across all teams. We have an internal Slack channel where on-callers can share lessons and ask each other for help which has been great for us to help level each other up. We’ve also ran regular on-call retros to help learning and sharing. We were very good at this in the early days, especially when we were a centralised group of on-callers, and it’s helped get us to where we are today. In a nutshell, listen to what your on-callers are saying you can do to improve, and act on it!</p>

<p>We also run a regular session at Monzo called ’Learning from Incidents’. This is a forum where engineers present an overview of an incident they’ve handled recently to a forum that’s open to anyone in the company to join. They nearly always start their stories with being paged for something, and it’s a great way to learn from the experiences of other teams.</p>

<h2 id="-the-end">👋 The End</h2>
<p>And that was that for the talk. I’m incredibly proud of how we’ve scaled things and where we’re at today - but I expect we’ll keep evolving as the needs of our customers and scale of our business change over time.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping that some of my lessons and advice can help you improve on-call wherever you work! 🤞 📟</p>

<h2 id="-somebody-elses-problem">🙈 Somebody Else’s Problem</h2>

<p>Recently my boss shared something with our Engineering Manager community dubbed ‘Somebody Else’s Problem’, or ‘SEP’. It’s a term coined by Douglas Adams in his 1982 novel ‘Life, the Universe and Everything’:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An SEP is something we can’t see, or don’t see, or our brain doesn’t let us see, because we think that it’s somebody else’s problem. That’s what SEP means. Somebody Else’s Problem. The brain just edits it out, it’s like a blind spot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I haven’t read the book, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_else%27s_problem">Wikipedia does a good job of explaining SEP in some more detail</a>).</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s been on my mind ever since. I’ve been reflecting on the problems I’m ignoring across my teams because I’m blind to them, or I’ve subconsciously badged them as somebody else’s. That period of reflection led me to writing this post to share the concept more widely.  Hopefully it prompts some thinking for you too!</p>

<h2 id="️-success-is-our-responsibility">🙋‍♂️ Success is our responsibility</h2>

<p>The concept of SEP dovetails nicely into the idea of responsibility. As leaders, we are ultimately responsible for the success of our teams and the problems they encounter. Whether the problems are clearly ours to solve, or they impact us but belong to someone else, it’s our responsibility to address them. Seeking out those problems that fall in the SEP category is particularly important. I bet they’re the ones that are slowing you down or blocking your progress. I have blind spots, no doubt - but that’s where the wider team come in. If <em>everyone</em> takes complete responsibility for the problems infront of us, our chances of success get a big boost.</p>

<p>As companies grow and teams expand, it’s easy to slip into thinking that someone else will take care of a problem. But, this mindset can lead to a lack of responsibility and a negative culture. In my experience, as we hire more people and and ownership lines are drawn between roles and teams, it becomes more tempting to point fingers and ask, “why should I solve the problem if the person or team who should be solving it isn’t?”. This is where our SEP blind spots start creeping in, and on reflection, there are definitely problems that I can lean into more in my organisation.</p>

<h2 id="-total-responsibility">💯 Total responsibility</h2>

<p>Over Christmas I was listening to <a href="https://www.thehighperformancepodcast.com/podcast/frank-lampard">a podcast with Frank Lampard</a>, a former professional footballer turned Premier League manager. He spoke about the importance of taking total responsibility for performance, both good and bad. He mentioned about how easy it is in football for players to think that team performance isn’t theirs to solve - blaming the defence, the strikers, or the tactics. He said something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘If you want to get better, you have to take responsibility - for good or for bad, I suppose…’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His point resonated with me as I realised it doesn’t really matter about the situation - a scrappy startup, a large enterprise, or even a football team. If there’s a problem impacting us, it’s our responsibility to solve it - regardless of whether we think it’s somebody else’s problem to solve or not.</p>

<p>I know that things are more complicated in practice than this (and I could go on exploring the anti-patterns taking responsibility for everything might introduce…), but I really like this concept of total responsbility and how SEP impacts it. I’ll use this post to hold myself accountable to take total responsibility for the problems impacting me and my teams in future. In particular, I’ll be keeping myself honest about what problems I’m ignoring.</p>

<p>To Frank Lampard’s point, whether we like it or not - it’s our job to take responsibility if we want to get better.</p>

I was surprised to see my last post was back in June last year, and after two weeks off from work, I feel like I’ve got the headspace to write again. Prioritisation has been heavy on my mind over the last ~3-4 months as the scope of my role has changed, so this feels like a decent topic to get stuck into.</p>

<p align="center"> 
  <img width="200" height="150" src="https://github.com/lukebriscoe/lukebriscoe.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/undraw_Prioritise_re_r5xu.png?raw=true" />
</p>

<h2 id="-set-clear-priorities">🔢 ‘Set clear priorities…’</h2>

<p>The most common bit of advice and feedback I’ve had through my leadership career is ‘you need to set clear priorities’. We all know that having clear priorities is important, but it’s easier said than done. As I’ve grown into more senior roles and taken on more responsibility, setting and sticking to my priorities has become <em>even more</em> important, but I’ve also learnt from the lessons (and pain) of not doing this well.</p>

<p>Setting clear priorities is important for me to do a good job, important for me to handle pressure well, but also incredibly important to avoid taking too much on and burning out.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, the scope of my role has increased a lot, and as such, I’ve had to make some tough priority calls and change the way I’m operating to allow me to lead effectively. Crucially, I’ve had to be very clear on what I <em>won’t</em> be doing. <br /></p>

<p>Here’s what my org looks like at the moment so you get an idea about why this has been so important - I’m realistic enough to know that I can’t operate as a manager for three teams, a manager of managers, and set direction for my org without effectively prioritising:</p>

<p align="center"> 
  <img width="700" height="300" src="https://github.com/lukebriscoe/lukebriscoe.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/Lukes%20org%20monzo.png?raw=true" />
</p>

<h2 id="️-getting-clear">😶‍🌫️ Getting clear</h2>
<p>Clearly, one of my top priorities needs to be to hire some managers in to some of those teams. I need to get the right team in place to free me up to operate at my best, so hiring is my top priority (nudge nudge - check out <a href="https://monzo.com/careers/">monzo.com/careers</a> 😉).
<br />
Part of the motivation behind me writing this post is to have something to hold myself accountable to. I’m not saying I’m great at all of these things, but they’re helping me get focused and see the light at the end of the tunnel. Hopefully they might help you too 🚇</p>

<h2 id="-my-rules-for-prioritising">📏 My rules for prioritising</h2>

<h3 id="1️⃣-stick-to-the-process">1️⃣ Stick to the process</h3>
<p>I’ve written previously about <a href="https://lukebriscoe.com/2019/09/16/managing-time.html">how I manage my time</a> - rule number one is to stick to my process for this. I know this way of working works for me and I’ve had success with it in the past - so stick to it!</p>

<h3 id="2️⃣-bounce-my-priorities-around-with-my-manager">2️⃣ Bounce my priorities around with my manager</h3>
<p>This has been very useful for me as they’ve been able to nudge me in the right direction where I’ve needed it. It’s also been good as they’ve been able to give me cover for some of the things I’ve had to drop or put on hold for a while. It’s been great for me to do this as I’ve had to be clear on what my priorities are ahead of our 1:1s — acting as a good forcing function for getting laser focused. Would definitely recommend you do this with your manager! 💯</p>

<h3 id="3️⃣-share-my-priorities-regularly">3️⃣ Share my priorities regularly</h3>
<p>I aim to be explicit with my teams about what my top priorities are at least monthly. That way they know where my time is being spent, and what I won’t be able to support on. They also know when and how to ask for my support - I’ve tried to set up some clear triggers for where I should be pulled in to decisions or challenges, and how I expect information to be pushed to me (for example, incidents my teams are handling, however minor - I don’t need all of the detail nor do I need to be across everything, but I do appreciate a quick briefing on anything interesting going on).</p>

<h3 id="4️⃣-shed-some-light-on-what-ive-been-doing">4️⃣ Shed some light on what I’ve been doing</h3>
<p>At the start of this year I created an internally-public Slack channel where every week (ish…) I share a digest of what I’ve been doing, where I’ve spent my energy, and some of the key lessons I’ve learnt. Anyone can drop in there to see what I’ve been upto. As I read back each week, it’s interesting to see if I’ve been focusing on the right things, and as the feedback loops are quite short, it’s given me the opportunity to course correct quickly.</p>

<h3 id="5️⃣-say-no">5️⃣ Say no</h3>
<p>I’m still learning about this. I like being helpful, and I don’t like saying no to things — but to ensure I’m doing a good job and looking after myself, I’ve had to get used to it. There’s probably a whole other post I can write about how I’ve tried to say no to things and ended up doing them anyway - but the rule is to say no where I can (or say no to something else in my top priorities so I can say yes).</p>

<h3 id="6️⃣-delegate">6️⃣ Delegate</h3>
<p>Where I can’t say no, my general rule is to either a) do it (and reprioritise and communicate those changes as a result), or b) delegate. In the last few months I’ve realised more than ever how powerful (and <em>empowering</em>) delegating can be, and it’s helped me create new opportunities for engineers and managers in my team that I wouldn’t have been able to find otherwise. I set clear outcomes to be delivered whenever I delegate, and then pop that onto my ‘Delegated - check in’ section in my priorities doc. I’ve enjoyed practicing this more recently.</p>

</p>

<h2 id="-challenges">😥 Challenges</h2>
<p>My rules generally serve me well, but there are plenty of problems that I bump in to:</p>

<h3 id="️guilt">👨‍⚖️Guilt</h3>
<p>I constantly feel guilty about all the things I’m not doing. At the moment whilst I’m managing lots of people, I generally have weekly 1:1s with my managers and tech leads, then fortnightly 1:1s with my engineers. I squeeze my skip-level 1:1s in when I can. By not being able to spend more time with everyone in my org, I feel guilty - what if I’ve missed something? What if someone needs me but is holding back because of how ‘busy’ I am? What if I’ve missed a problem in one of the squads that I could help resolve before it turns into something more serious?<br />
I don’t quite know yet how to properly manage this - other than telling myself it’s ok. Advice appreciated here if you’re reading this and have conquered your guilt!</p>

<h3 id="-saying-no">😐 Saying no</h3>
<p>I don’t like saying no. Sometimes I feel like I’ve missed opportunities because I’ve had to prioritise something else - for example, I said no to a good speaking opportunity recently because there’s just no space in my schedule (or my brain) for me to have taken it and done it justice. I know that’s the right thing to do, but it’s still a challenge…</p>

<h3 id="-balancing-work-and-life">🧠 Balancing work and life</h3>
<p>I’ve fell into bad habits at times that have meant that I’ve worked evenings + long days just to keep on top of everything (performance review periods are classic for this). In the short-term, it’s great as I feel like I’m getting through my to-do list, but in the medium-long term, I’m left exhausted. Crucially I’ve allowed myself to miss out on things like helping get my children to bed, or turning down going out for a beer with friends, because I’m using that time to churn through my to-do list. My holiday recently was much needed, and part of that was because I was working long days in the run up. I’m not expected to work these hours by my employer btw - it was a symptom of me not sticking well enough to my priorities, and saying ‘yes’ to too many things.<br /> 
I perform at my best if I’m working sensible hours, and I’ve been able to get to the gym and grab a coffee before I start work - and the more I let that slip, the less effective I am day-to-day. The challenge here is how I stick to the things I know I need to do that help me be at my best. I can do better!</p>

<h2 id="️-the-priority-battle">⚔️ The priority battle</h2>
<p>I think I’ve came to the conclusion that prioritising well is always going to be a battle. I’ll lose sometimes and make the wrong calls, but as long as I’m sticking to a process that I know works, and I’m building in the time I need personally to be at my best, then I can hit a good rhythm. Staying true to my current priorities means that I’ll have more time in the future - I’ve just got to execute against them.</p>

Prioritisation has been heavy on my mind over the last ~3-4 months as the scope of my role has changed, so this feels like a decent topic to get stuck into.]]></summary></entry></feed>
