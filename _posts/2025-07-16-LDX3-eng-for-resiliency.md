I was lucky enough to be invited to [run a workshop on the Director+ track this year at LDX3 (LeadDev) in London](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london/agenda/).

My personal highlight from the workshop was how engaged everyone was â€” it was great to hear everyoneâ€™s stories and experiences, and it was great to see everyoneâ€™s commitment to learning and sharing. If youâ€™re reading this and you were there â€” thank you!

[The slides I used in the workshop are available on Github](https://github.com/lukebriscoe/ldx3-2025/blob/main/LDX3-LB-2025.pdf).

I aimed to deliver two key outcomes:

1. Equip everyone with some new tools and techniques for identifying and mitigating engineering risks, and introduce the concept of anti-fragility
2. Share some of the key capabilities to build to help respond effectively when things inevitably go wrong

Everything I shared is from my own personal experience, and things I practice day-to-day building anti-fragile, resilient systems. I had a great time running the session, and I've had some great follow-up conversations since. If youâ€™d like me to run a similar workshop to explore some of these concepts with your teams, please get in touch through one of the links on my [about page](https://lukebriscoe.com/about/).
