I"Ù<p>So, 2019 went quickly! Hereâ€™s a little round up of some of the key things Iâ€™ve learnt this year.</p>

<h2 id="-working-from-home"><strong>ğŸ¡ Working from home</strong></h2>

<p>Underrated in so many ways. This year was the first time Iâ€™d worked from home regularly in a role, and itâ€™s something Iâ€™d really encourage everyone to do more where they can. I had to learn how to balance my time right, and make sure that I managed to find a good separation between <em>working</em> at home and <em>being</em> at home.</p>

<p>I have a good balance now of time spent in the office (usually around 2 days a week), and the other 3 from home. Iâ€™ve actually learnt that I perform better by being able to fully remove myself from the distractions that come with an open office environment, and really focus in on something when I need to.Â </p>

<h2 id="-commuting"><strong>ğŸš† Commuting</strong></h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve learnt to make the most out of my commuting time this year. It takes me around 3 hours each way to commute in to the office, of which I can get about 1.5 hours of actual working time in (when Iâ€™m not waiting for connecting trains or the tube). Iâ€™ve become really disciplined with how I use this time to focus on things that Iâ€™d usually deprioritise if I was stretched for time; things like reading, tidying up and organising my diary and to-do lists, and watching those talks that I never get round to ğŸ˜›. Using the time here to do those things relieves the pressure on my time elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="ï¸-flexibility-is-important"><strong>ğŸ¤¸â€â™‚ï¸ Flexibility is important</strong></h2>

<p>I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d take another role where I couldnâ€™t (mostly) set my own schedule and work to it. Iâ€™ve learnt how important this flexibility is to me this year, and I consciously try to always make sure my team know that theyâ€™re free to work in a way that works best for them and for the company. If Iâ€™m up early one day and feel like I want to start work at 7:30 (knowing that Iâ€™ll be at my most productive if I do), then itâ€™s great to know I can do that; likewise if Iâ€™m not feeling at my best one day and want to juggle my working hours around.</p>

<h2 id="-public-speaking"><strong>ğŸ¤ Public speaking</strong></h2>

<p>Itâ€™s not so bad(!). I did my first public speaking gigs this year and on the whole, I really enjoyed them. I learnt that being well prepared is really important, and Iâ€™m looking forward to taking up more opportunities to speak some more next year.

<h2 id="mental-health-and-wellbeing"><strong>ğŸ§ Mental health and wellbeing</strong></h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve learnt so much this year about mental health, and itâ€™s largely due to Monzoâ€™s commitment to making talking about it a part of everyday life. Iâ€™ve learnt that our physical and mental health are linked, and Iâ€™ve also learnt that <strong>everyone</strong> is affected by it in some way. Reducing the stigma about talking about mental health is something Iâ€™m committed to keep working on in the future, and Iâ€™m really interested to keep on learning next year.</p>

<h2 id="ï¸language"><strong>ğŸ—£ï¸Language</strong></h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve always been interested in the power of language, but this year Iâ€™ve had my eyes opened even more to the impact the words you use can have on people. Something Iâ€™ve become much more aware of are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression">microaggresions</a>. Iâ€™ve learnt that because microaggressions are often so subtle, itâ€™s hard to know sometimes that youâ€™re even using them. I used to refer to groups of people as â€˜guysâ€™ all of the time until I learnt that, actually, that term can make some people feel excluded. There are a few other terms that Iâ€™ve tuned in to recently that Iâ€™m trying to be more considerate of using like â€˜crazyâ€™ or â€˜madâ€™, and using â€˜distributed workingâ€™ instead of â€˜remote workingâ€™. All of these subtle changes in language can go a long way to making people feel included, which until this year, Iâ€™d been unaware of in the past.</p>

<h2 id="writing"><strong>ğŸ“Writing</strong></h2>

<p>Writing is easier and more enjoyable than I thought it would be! I started my blog up in August with a goal of writing one post per month for the rest of the year, which Iâ€™m really happy that Iâ€™ve achieved. Iâ€™ve found that once I get going with a rough idea of what Iâ€™d like to write about, these posts pull themselves together pretty quickly. Iâ€™m not short of ideas of things to write about, so Iâ€™m hoping to keep this up next year too ğŸ–Šï¸</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s to another year of learning in 2020! ğŸ™Œ</p>
