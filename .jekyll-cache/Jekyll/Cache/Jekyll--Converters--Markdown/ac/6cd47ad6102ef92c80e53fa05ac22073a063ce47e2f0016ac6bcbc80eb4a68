I"<p>Monday to Friday, I work in software engineering. The weekend is for football. My team is West Bromwich Albion and we play in the second tier of the English professional football pyramid, aka The Championship. We’ve had better times, but in recent years we’ve slipped into mediocrity and have struggled to mount a real attempt to make it back to the riches of the Premier League. Surprisingly, the emotional rollercoaster of watching football at The Hawthorns (our home stadium) has taught me more about my day job than I expected.</p>
