<p>Last month I went over to San Diego to speak at the <a href="https://x.finops.org/">FinOps X conference</a>. The conference is ~2000 people from all kinds of backgrounds â€” engineers, accountants, analysts and other FinOps professionals. Iâ€™ve been aware of the foundation and the work they do for the last couple of years, so I was thrilled when our talk proposal was accepted. We shared our cloud cost journey at Monzo to-date, and dug into how weâ€™re solving some of the unique problems a microservices architecture can present when it comes to accurately forecasting and attributing cloud spend.</p>

<p>I gave the talk with my colleague Selda, who leads our Cloud FinOps squad at Monzo. One of the key insights we shared was how weâ€™ve got into a much better place with our cloud costs as a result of collaborating across different disciplines â€” namely by combining backend engineers with data scientists, analytics engineers and accountants. As a result, on forecasting cloud spend alone weâ€™ve gone from a ~15% error rate in our forecasts to consistently predicting spend to over 95% accuracy. Thatâ€™s improving every month, and weâ€™re at around 97.5% at the time Iâ€™m writing this post (with our goal set to consistently be above 99%).</p>
