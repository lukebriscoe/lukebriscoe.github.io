I"	<p>I came across the ‘trust battery’ metaphor recently when reading <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm">‘It Doesn’t Have To Be Crazy At Work’</a> by Basecamp co-founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. The metaphor was apparently coined by Tobi Lütke, founder and CEO at Shopify. While I don’t agree with everything I’ve seen Tobi speak about in the past, I do really like this as a concept. As it’s been on my mind a bit recently, I thought I’d put a quick post together about it.</p>
