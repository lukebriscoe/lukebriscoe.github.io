<p>I was lucky enough to be invited to <a href="https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london/agenda/">run a workshop on the Director+ track this year at LDX3 (LeadDev) in London</a>.</p>

<p>My personal highlight from the workshop was how engaged everyone was — it was great to hear everyone’s stories and experiences, and it was great to see everyone’s commitment to learning and sharing. If you’re reading this and you were there — thank you!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lukebriscoe/ldx3-2025/blob/main/LDX3-LB-2025.pdf">The slides I used in the workshop are available on Github</a>.</p>

<p>I had a great time running the session, and I’ve had some great follow-up conversations (and some lovely feedback!) since. If you’d like me to run a similar workshop to explore some of these concepts with your teams, please get in touch through one of the links on my <a href="https://lukebriscoe.com/about/">about page</a>!</p>

<hr />
<p>In the workshop I aim to deliver two key outcomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Equip everyone with some new tools and techniques for identifying and mitigating engineering risks, and introduce the concept of anti-fragility</li>
  <li>Share some of the key capabilities to build to help respond effectively when things inevitably go wrong</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything I share is from my own personal experience, and things I practice day-to-day building anti-fragile, resilient systems.</p>
