<p>Recently I’ve been thinking a lot about mediocrity.</p>

<p>To be fair that’s mainly come from the standard of football I’ve been watching this season (<a href="https://lukebriscoe.com/leadership-belief-wba/">see my post from late last year</a>) but it’s also been on my mind when it comes to leading high performing engineering teams.</p>

<p>One thing I learned early in my career as a result of getting burned from getting it so wrong is to constantly gauge the bar of your middle performers.</p>

<p>I believe that most orgs know who their high and low performers are. But, they know less about their people in the middle — the people who do a good enough job, most of the time. It is also my belief that “the middle” is where your performance bar is set, and where it is held — and if you’re not regularly gauging how that group is doing and raising your standards, then you’re at risk of building a mediocre organisation.</p>

<p>And yes, that’s fine in some places. But not in high growth or high ambition places. There’s a place for good enough — but it’s generally not in ambitious, high performing orgs 🥸</p>

<p>I’m writing this post because this has been on my mind recently and last week on a flight to the US I re-read “Amp It Up” by Frank Slootman. Sure enough, I enjoyed reading it again and I re-discovered one of my favourite references on mediocrity. From my notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mediocrity — if you want a great company, you can’t give out free passes for mediocrity… Good enough is never good enough.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that alone is worth reading the book for. If you haven’t read it and you’re a leader of teams, regardless of the industry you work in — you should. Raise the bar. Sharpen your focus. And make sure you’re building for great, not just good enough.</p>
