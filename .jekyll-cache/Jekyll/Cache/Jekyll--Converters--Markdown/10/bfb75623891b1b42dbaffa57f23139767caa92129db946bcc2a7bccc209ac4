I"ù<p>Monday to Friday, I work in software engineering. The weekend is for football. My team is West Bromwich Albion and we play in the second tier of the English professional football pyramid, aka The Championship. Weâ€™ve had good times, but in recent years weâ€™ve slipped into mediocrity and have struggled to mount a real attempt to make it back to the top tier and the riches of the Premier League. Surprisingly, the emotional rollercoaster of watching football at The Hawthorns (our home stadium) has taught me more about my day job than I expected.</p>

<p>When results arenâ€™t going our way on the pitch, everyone has an opinion. The formation is wrong. That player doesnâ€™t care. The manager is clueless. When Iâ€™m watching some of the most mediocre football of my life, I wonâ€™t lie, my reaction is exactly the same. We judge the team on outcomes and we want to see passion, commitment, and wins. And when we donâ€™t get those things, well, we start to point fingers at individuals. And more often than not, those fingers point at the manager.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago we were playing a home game and I took the photo below after weâ€™d just drew 0-0 to a team who are rock bottom of the league (sorry Sheffield Wednesday fans). I was a bit late with my snap but the photo shows Karlan Grant, one of our players, just after he finished having an argument with a fan in the stands. I donâ€™t know what said, but what I do think is that a) heâ€™s frustrated enough to bite back to criticism from the stands and b) there were 3 or 4 of his teammates running towards him to drag him away. For me there are some positives to take from that â€” he cares enough to bite, and his teammates care enough to at least steer him away from getting involved further.</p>

<p>In my day job Iâ€™ve learned that building a team, especially one operating at high velocity with high stakes, is rarely as simple as assembling a team of competent professionals and leaving them to it. Iâ€™ve also learnt that itâ€™s wise to deeply understand and then be hard on the problem, rather than immediately on the individual.</p>

<p>And more often than not, the issue isnâ€™t competence (though yes, sometimes it is). The problems generally lie elsewhere â€” and my main message in this post is that in football, just like in software engineering, not everything is as it may seemâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="-the-invisible-game">ğŸ«¥ The invisible game</h2>

<p>From the stands, we donâ€™t see the training ground. We donâ€™t see the personal issues a player is carrying, the tactical instruction theyâ€™ve been given that restricts their flair, or the quiet lack of confidence rippling through the dressing room after a few bad results.
It is exactly the same in engineering. However â€” when an engineering squad misses a deadline or a platform migration stalls, the first thing we ask is â€œwhat are the factors contributing to this?â€ before we sack the manager or change the team. In football however, we jump to ask â€œwhy arenâ€™t they working harder?â€ or â€œsack the manager!â€ after a few bad results (hi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mason">Ryan Mason ğŸ‘‹</a>).</p>

<p>This is where the invisible side of the game comes in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the team paralysed by a fear of making a mistake? (e.g. shipping a bug to production?)</li>
  <li>Do they actually believe in what theyâ€™re doing? (e.g. do they see the impact their efforts will result in and can they influence the methods to take them there?)</li>
  <li>Do they have a manager that inspires them to do better (e.g. are they learning and growing with their help?)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-belief">ğŸ§˜ Belief</h2>

<p>West Brom canâ€™t buy success by buying the best players and the best manager. We donâ€™t have the money and weâ€™re not. In order to succeed we have to be greater than the sum of our parts â€” we have to believe. Now I have no idea whether this team have belief or not as Iâ€™m not there behind the scenes, but in my job, I know that belief is a multiplier.</p>

<p>When a team believes in the mission, they understand the outcomes theyâ€™re working towards, and they trust their manager has their back, they play with their heads up. They take calculated risks. They cover for each otherâ€™s mistakes rather than pointing fingers. They share ownership over problems.</p>

<p>When that belief is gone (e.g. when the dressing room is lost),  it doesnâ€™t matter how talented your senior engineers or your star players are. You get slow decision-making, a lack of cohesion, and a culture of â€œthatâ€™s not my job.â€ You get bad or less optimal outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="-the-final-whistle">ğŸ˜— The final whistle</h2>

<p>Engineering, like football, is a results business. We are here to ship, to scale, and to win. But you donâ€™t get results by staring at the scoreboard. You get them by obsessing over the culture in the dressing room.</p>

<p>So next time youâ€™re at the match and screaming for the manager to make a sub, take a breath. The 90 minutes we watch each week is only half the story. Weâ€™ll probably never truly understand whatâ€™s going on behind the scenes â€” but what we can do is look for whether we think the players are playing with belief and focus. If theyâ€™re not, then maybe it is actually time to start arguing with the players at the end of the match and put that belief to the testâ€¦</p>
