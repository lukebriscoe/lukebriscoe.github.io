<div id="about-me"> 
	<p align="center"> I'm an engineering leader based in the UK.
    I’ve been working with <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo Bank</a> since February 2019 where I lead Platform engineering. In practice that means I'm responsible for the compute, storage, data platform, and engineering experience teams at the company.
    <br>
 <br>
    I'm interested in distributed systems, reliability engineering and effective incident management. I love helping people and companies grow and scale, but I'm not currently open to new opportunities 📈

    Previously, I've worked in technology and engineering roles with EnTech company <a href="https://ovo.com/">OVO</a>, luxury home and fashion retailer <a href="https://www.thewhitecompany.com/uk/">The White Company</a>, and health and beauty retailer <a href="https://www.boots.com/">Boots</a>. I've also spent some time in the public sector as a technology consultant with the Department for Education 👨🏼‍💻
