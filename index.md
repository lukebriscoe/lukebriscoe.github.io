<div id="about-me"> 
<br>
I love building and operating resilient distributed systems. I’m always open to talking about reliability engineering, developer experience, FinOps, incident management, and company hypergrowth 🏎
<br>
<br>
🏦 I’m currently an Engineering Director at <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo Bank</a> leading Platform engineering. 
<br>
<br>
I joined Monzo in early 2019 where I’m responsible for building a world-class technology and data platform to make money work for everyone. 
<br>
<br>
Before Monzo I worked in various engineering and technology roles with <a href="https://ovo.com/">OVO</a>, <a href="https://www.thewhitecompany.com/uk/">The White Company</a>, and <a href="https://www.boots.com/">Boots</a>. I’ve also spent some time as a consultant in the public sector with the UK Department for Education
